<!-- <p>To ensure the <strong>TheSilchar1000</strong> brand maintains its prestige and the &quot;Reflected Visibility&quot; engine actually works, you need a firm set of &quot;Rules of the Club.&quot; These guidelines prevent the platform from becoming a spammy directory and ensure every member contributes to the collective growth.</p> -->
<h2 id="the-bos1000-community-guidelines">The TheSilchar1000 Community Guidelines</h2>
<h3 id="-1-the-face-brand-identity-rule-"><strong>The &quot;Face-Brand&quot; Identity Rule</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Real People Only:</strong> Your profile must feature a high-quality, professional photograph of the founder or lead service provider.</li>
<li><strong>The &quot;Human&quot; Bio:</strong> Your business description should be written in the first person. Tell the story of <em>why</em> you do what you do. People buy from people.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="-2-the-reciprocity-mandate-the-synergy-loop-"><strong>The Reciprocity Mandate (The Synergy Loop)</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cross-Promotion:</strong> Members are encouraged to share the &quot;BOS Deals&quot; page or another member&#39;s profile on their social media at least once a month.</li>
<li><strong>The &quot;BOS First&quot; Pledge:</strong> When you need a service (a lawyer, a plumber, or a caterer), check the TheSilchar1000 directory first. Support the network that supports you.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="-3-content-quality-standards-"><strong>Content Quality Standards</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Media Integrity:</strong> All photos and videos uploaded must be original. Using stock photos or low-resolution, blurry images is prohibited as it lowers the brand value for the other 999 members.</li>
<li><strong>Honest Offers:</strong> &quot;BOS Exclusive Deals&quot; must be genuine. Inflating prices only to offer a &quot;discount&quot; is strictly forbidden and can lead to membership suspension.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="-4-review-integrity-"><strong>Review Integrity</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>No &quot;Fake&quot; Praise:</strong> Do not buy reviews or use &quot;review farms.&quot; We value the authentic voice of Silchar&#39;s citizens.</li>
<li><strong>Professionalism in Feedback:</strong> If a member receives a negative review, they must respond professionally and seek to resolve the issue. We are a club of excellence; we handle complaints with grace.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="-5-the-active-node-requirement-"><strong>The &quot;Active Node&quot; Requirement</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Profile Freshness:</strong> To stay high in the search rankings, members should update their &quot;Deal of the Week&quot; or portfolio photos at least once every quarter.</li>
<li><strong>Event Participation:</strong> While not mandatory, members are strongly encouraged to attend the annual &quot;Silchar Excellence Awards&quot; and networking mixers to strengthen the physical bond of the network.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id="-enforcement-the-seat-policy-"><strong>Enforcement &amp; The &quot;Seat&quot; Policy</strong></h3>
<p>Because there are only <strong>1000 seats</strong>, they are highly coveted.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Warnings:</strong> Minor violations of the guidelines will result in a &quot;Yellow Card&quot; (temporary hidden profile).</li>
<li><strong>Termination:</strong> Repeated violations or unethical business practices will lead to the permanent termination of membership.</li>
<li><strong>The Auction Loop:</strong> Terminated seats will be immediately moved to the <strong>Public Auction</strong> tier (starting at ₹1 Lakh+), ensuring that the club always consists of the most committed businesses in the city.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id="-technical-tip-for-the-js-expert-"><strong>Technical Tip for the JS Expert</strong></h3>
<p>To make these guidelines feel &quot;interactive&quot; during onboarding, you can implement a <strong>&quot;Guideline Quiz&quot;</strong> or an <strong>&quot;Interactive Agreement&quot;</strong> in your JS form:</p>
<ol>
<li>Instead of a long &quot;Terms and Conditions&quot; box that nobody reads, use a <strong>Step-by-Step Toggle</strong>.</li>
<li>The user must click &quot;I Agree&quot; or &quot;I Understand&quot; for each of the 5 pillars before the &quot;Pay &amp; Join&quot; button becomes active.</li>
<li><strong>The &quot;Live&quot; Code Hint:</strong> Use <code>localStorage</code> or a state management tool to track their progress through the guidelines so they don&#39;t have to restart if they refresh the page.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Next Step:</strong>
Now that we have the rules, would you like me to help you create the <strong>&quot;BOS Deals&quot; Page Structure</strong>—the layout that will showcase the weekly promotions to the public?</p>
